      I am a person that is passionate about nature and would spend all of my time surrounded by nature if this world made that a possibility for me. Unfortunately, I have found myself deeply submerged in the middle of urban environments my entire life. My Native American bloodline, Ojibwe, cries out to me to seek nature and become one with it. My inability to do this while living in a big city led to this piece of art.
      <br>
      Every day I walked my way through the city, looking for nature. I saw rigid shapes, man-made objects jutting up from the ground. I looked harder, trying to see past this and instead found degradation. I studied this decay found it spreading, reaching itself out as cracks like tendrils search for a meal. I was becoming lost in the urban jungle; I just wanted to see the sky. I looked up and saw the sky reflected in hundreds of windows, but I did not see the sky. My soul was becoming as broken as this hard, cold, urban decay around me.
      <br>
      I wanted this are to represent what I really saw and what I wanted to see. I also wanted it to be a piece that people could touch to help submerge them into my vision.
      <br>
      I saw shapes in the city, such as individual bricks, outlines of entire buildings, and street signs. I used these shapes and created 3D replicas of them using multiple layers of raw canvas. 
      <br>
      After studying these shapes, I decided that I wanted them not just to look broken but be broken, like the city. I created burst pockets filled with replicas of decay. I made replicas of decaying wood using linocuts, rusted pocking metal by building up layers of acrylic paint and after dry using a blowtorch on it, and carving dry plaster into further decay that I saw. I used these pieces as moulds for liquid latex. I decided that the latex should be the colour of rust.
      <br>
      I considered how these shapes should feel. I wanted them to feel like building, cold and hard, grainy. I mixed coarse builders sand into gesso and covered the top section of the 3D pieces, allowing the back pieces to fall back further, letting them look stretched out as cities do.
      <br>
      Next, I had to consider the colours. I looked around the city for colours. I found them; one the colour of grass, another the colour of pyracantha berries. Finally, I found a mix of colours in the city that mirrored colours found in nature. I painted these in oil paint
      <br>
      Finally, I could move onto the background. I knew that I wanted it to look like the sky, which I saw reflected in the windows. I also wanted it to reflect the spread of brokenness, the cracks that spread and spread without intervention.  Again, I wanted it to feel like how the city feels to me. I used builders plaster, mixed it into my gesso, and made a hard and cold background. I then spent many hours carving cracks from the broken shapes to the canvas edges. I painted the sky that I longed to see, and I let the colours from each broken shape bleed through these cracks.
