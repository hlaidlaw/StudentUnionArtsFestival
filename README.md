# Student Union Arts Festival Website

As a second year student at Aberystwyth Univeristy, I volunteered to be part of a 2 person team that created an online gallery to host 
this years Arts Festival. 

The aim of the site was to mimic a gallery and how a visitor would feel at the arts festival, if like previous years the art festival was in person.

The format of the website was to have a main page (created by my colleague Robin) with six doors : performance, written, photography, music, digital, and craft.
These doors linked to the pages I made with the art submitted in frames on the main page. Individual works on this page could also be selected and then
the user is taken to a page with a large version of the artwork and a description, this mimics in a real gallery moving closer to the artwork to understand more.


Due to privacy reasons , only one room can be shared here, with some of the names removed.

In this repository there is the code for the craft room.
